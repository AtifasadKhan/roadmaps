# Basic Syntax

Understanding the basics is the key to a solid foundation. In this section, learn the basic terminologies, naming conventions, reserved words, conditions, functions, data structures, OOP, packages, etc.

- To print output use --> System.out.println();
- To take input from user --> Scanner or BufferedReader class can be used

# Data Types and Variables

Variable in Java is a data container that stores the data values during Java program execution. Every variable is assigned a data type, which designates the type and quantity of values it can hold. Variable is a memory location name of the data. The Java variables have mainly three types: Local, Instance and Static.

Data Types are divided into two group -

- Primitive - byte,short,int,long,float,double,boolean and char
- Non-Primitive - String, Arrays and Classes

# Conditionals

Java has the following conditional statements:

- Use `if` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use `else` to specify a block of code to be executed if the same condition is false
- Use `else if` to specify a new condition to test; if the first condition is false
- Use `switch` to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
- Use `?,:` operator to specify one line condition

# Functions

A method/function is a way to perform some task. Similarly, in programming like Java, a function method is a block of code written to perform a specific task repeatedly. It provides reusability of code. We write the function once and use it many times. It works on the 'DRY' principle i.e., "Do not repeat yourself".

Steps -

1. Define function - datatype function_name(parameters){body}
2. Call function - function_name(values)

# Datastructures

As the name indicates itself, a **Data Structure** is a way of organizing the data in the **memory** so that it can be used efficiently. Some common data structures are array, linked list, stack, hashtable, queue, tree, heap, and graph.

- Array allocates continuous memory for homogeneous data
- Linked List stores data in nodes with references
- Stack follows Last In First Out principle
- Queue follows First In First Out principle

# OOP

Object-oriented programming is a core of Java Programming, which is used for designing a program using classes and objects. This can also be characterized as data controlling for accessing the code.

- [Object](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classes-objects-java/)

# Loops

In Java and other programming languages, loops are used to iterate a part of the program several times. There are four types of loops in Java, `for`, `forEach`, `while`, and `do...while`.

- Synatx of `for` loop is `for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement){}`
- Syntax of `forEach` loop is `for(data_type variable:array_name){}`
