#JS Varialbes

# [var] keyword

The var statement declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

# [let] keyword

The `let` declaration declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

# [const] keyword

Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the `let` keyword. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator), and it can't be redeclared (i.e. through a variable declaration). However, if a constant is an object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed.

#DATA STRUCTURE

# Arrays

Arrays are objects that store a collection of items and can be assigned to a variable. They have their methods that can perform operations on the array.

# Map

[Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) is a collection of keyed data items, just like an `Object`. But the main difference is that `Map` allows keys of any type.

# JSON

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).

#LOOPS

# for...in statement

The for...in statement iterates over all enumerable properties of an object that are keyed by strings (ignoring ones keyed by Symbols), including inherited enumerable properties.

- [for...in statement - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in)
- [The for..in loop with examples](https://javascript.info/object#forin)

# for...of statement

The for...of statement executes a loop that operates on a sequence of values sourced from an iterable object. Iterable objects include instances of built-ins such as Array, String, TypedArray, Map, Set, NodeList (and other DOM collections), and the arguments object, generators produced by generator functions, and user-defined iterables.

# The for loop

The `for` loop is a standard control-flow construct in many programming languages, including JavaScript. It's commonly used to iterate over given sequences or iterate a known number of times and execute a piece of code for each iteration.

#FUNCTIONS

# Defining and Calling Functions

**Defining:**

- JavaScript function _declarations_ are made by using the `function` keyword.
- Functions can also be defined by saving function _expressions_ to a variable. "Arrow" functions are commonly used in this way.

**Calling:**

- When a function is defined, it is not yet executed.
- To call and invoke a function's code, use the function's name followed by parentheses: `functionName()`.

- [Calling Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#calling_functions)

# Arrow Functions

Arrow Function is a new way of creating functions with the '=>' operator with a shorter syntax.
